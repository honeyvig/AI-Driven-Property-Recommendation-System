# AI-Driven-Property-Recommendation-System
We are developing an innovative property recommendation application based on artificial intelligence. Users can upload photos of properties they like and receive recommendations of similar properties based on visual characteristics. We are looking for a Data Scientist specialized in computer vision and machine learning to implement a simple, efficient, and high-precision visual recommendation system using pre-trained models to optimize the process.

Responsibilities:

    Design and implement a deep learning model to identify visual similarities between properties.
    Configure and integrate a pre-trained model (e.g., MobileNet, ResNet) to extract visual features from images uploaded by users.
    Develop an image comparison system that enables the AI to identify similar properties in our database based on feature vectors.
    Collaborate with the backend development team to ensure smooth integration of the model into the application.
    Conduct accuracy testing and model optimization to ensure precise recommendations and fast response times.

Requirements:

    Proven experience in computer vision and convolutional neural network (CNN) models, especially for visual similarity applications.
    Knowledge of pre-trained models and experience with Transfer Learning.
    Experience with tools such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and image recognition platforms like Google Vision API or Amazon Rekognition.
    Proficiency in Python and familiarity with databases and vector indexing tools (FAISS, KD-trees).
    Ability to collaborate with other developers and communicate clearly and effectively.

Project Duration: 4-6 weeks, with the possibility of extension based on results and progress.

Contract Type: Remote work, temporary contract. This is a part-time position, with weekly sync meetings and progress reviews.

Budget: Please specify your hourly rate or a project-based proposal.

Application Instructions:

    Include examples of similar projects previously completed (especially those involving visual recommendations or computer vision).
    Attach or describe your specific experience implementing pre-trained models and using computer vision APIs.
==================================
Hereâ€™s an implementation approach for the described AI-driven property recommendation application:
1. Framework and Libraries

    TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch: To work with pre-trained CNNs like ResNet or MobileNet.
    FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): For fast similarity searches in high-dimensional feature vectors.
    Flask or FastAPI: For backend API development to integrate the recommendation system.
    Pandas/NumPy: For data handling.
    OpenCV/Pillow: For image processing.

2. Feature Extraction with Pre-trained CNNs

Use a pre-trained model to extract visual features from property images.

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import ResNet50
from tensorflow.keras.applications.resnet50 import preprocess_input
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image

# Load the ResNet50 model
base_model = ResNet50(weights='imagenet')
model = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=base_model.layers[-2].output)

def extract_features(image_path):
    # Load and preprocess the image
    img = Image.open(image_path).resize((224, 224))
    img_array = np.array(img)
    img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0)
    img_array = preprocess_input(img_array)

    # Extract features
    features = model.predict(img_array)
    return features.flatten()

# Example
image_features = extract_features("property_image.jpg")
print("Extracted Features:", image_features)

3. Building the Similarity Search System

Integrate FAISS for efficient similarity searches.

import faiss

# Example feature database (add extracted feature vectors)
feature_database = np.random.random((1000, 2048)).astype('float32')

# Create FAISS index
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(2048)  # L2 distance
index.add(feature_database)

def find_similar_images(query_features, top_k=5):
    query_features = np.expand_dims(query_features, axis=0).astype('float32')
    distances, indices = index.search(query_features, top_k)
    return indices, distances

# Example query
similar_indices, distances = find_similar_images(image_features)
print("Similar Images Indices:", similar_indices)
print("Distances:", distances)

4. Backend API

Expose the recommendation system via an API using Flask.

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/recommend', methods=['POST'])
def recommend():
    uploaded_image = request.files['image']
    query_features = extract_features(uploaded_image)
    similar_indices, distances = find_similar_images(query_features)

    # Example response with property IDs
    similar_properties = [{"property_id": int(idx), "distance": float(dist)} for idx, dist in zip(similar_indices[0], distances[0])]
    return jsonify(similar_properties)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)

5. Database and Feature Storage

Store extracted features in a database (e.g., PostgreSQL for metadata + FAISS for vector storage).
6. Testing and Optimization

    Use Mean Average Precision (mAP) or precision@k to evaluate recommendation accuracy.
    Optimize the FAISS index with clustering (e.g., IVF) for scalability.

7. Deployment

Deploy using cloud services like AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Run, or Dockerized containers for scalability.

This framework ensures a modular and efficient system, providing real-time property recommendations based on visual characteristics. Let me know if you'd like detailed steps on any part of the process!
